In this project, I have predicted the similarity between movies using a dataset that contains top 100 movies with summaries from IMDB and wikipedia. Next I have used K-means clustering algorithm and calculated similarity distance using cosine similarity to create dendrogram for better visibility.
Topics involved in this project:
- Machine Learning
- Natural Language Processing
- Data Visualization
- Data manipulation
